### Requirements

- Go
- Python
- Image Magick

### Instructions

```sh
./build.sh
```

The script will generate the logo with the following variants:

* Animated and Still SVG
* PNG with and without Alpha channel
* Regular and large sizes

### Sizing

The large logos are for reference. It is recommended to use the **regular** size
variants with thicker lines for most uses like on the web or for social media
avatars.

### Favicon

The favicon should be handled manually for best results. Check
`out/favicon/out000.svg` for an SVG file that can serve as the basis for
creating a good favicon.
